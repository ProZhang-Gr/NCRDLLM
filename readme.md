Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in cancer drug response. However, most existing methods are limited to predicting a single type of ncRNA, failing to fully capture the complex semantic associations between multimodal biological features, and thus exhibit weak generalizability and robustness. To overcome these limitations, this study leverages the strong capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in integrating heterogeneous biological data and capturing complex biomolecular relationships. In this study, a novel method, NCRDLLM, is proposed for predicting ncRNA–drug responses using a large language model (LLM). It is a unified framework for predicting associations between three types of ncRNA (circular RNA, microRNA, and long non-coding RNA) and drugs. The method integrates 19,020 experimentally validated associations and 120,012 disease association records. Three types of multimodal features are constructed: sequence features extracted using pretrained foundation models RNA-FM and ChemBERTa, structural features derived from RNA secondary structure graphs, drug fingerprints and graph representations, and association features encoded from disease association networks. These features are subsequently mapped into the hidden space of LLaMA-3.2-3B through adapter modules, with LoRA employed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that NCRDLLM achieves AUC-ROC values of 0.9636, 0.9662 and 0.9616 on miRNA-drug, lncRNA-drug, and circRNA-drug datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module, while literature evidence and tissue-specific expression profiling further support the biological relevance of the predictions. NCRDLLM provides an effective strategy for identifying potential ncRNA–drug response associations.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in cancer drug response; however, existing prediction methods are limited to single ncRNA types and fail to adequately capture complex semantic associations among multimodal biological features. This study presents NCRDLLM, ncRNA-Drug Response prediction via Large Language Model, a unified framework for predicting associations between three ncRNA subtypes—circular RNAs, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs—and drugs. The method integrates 18,036 experimentally validated associations and 120,012 disease association records. Three types of multimodal features were constructed: sequence features extracted using pretrained foundation models RNA-FM and ChemBERTa, structural features derived from RNA secondary structure graphs and drug fingerprints and graph data, and relational features encoded from disease association networks. These features were subsequently mapped into the hidden space of LLaMA-3.2-3B through adapter modules, with LoRA employed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Five-fold cross-validation demonstrated that NCRDLLM achieved AUC-ROC values of 0.9636, 0.9616, and 0.9662 on miRNA-drug, lncRNA-drug, and circRNA-drug datasets, respectively, representing improvements of 1.3\%, 3.5\%, and 3.1\% over the second-best methods. Ablation experiments confirmed the necessity of each module, while literature validation and tissue-specific expression analysis further substantiated the model's effectiveness, providing a promising strategy for predicting potential response associations between ncRNAs and drugs.
